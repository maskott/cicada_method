<h1>Cicada Method Test</h1>
<h2>My Bianary Blowout!</h2>
<p>Alright, so check it out.  This test was inspired by <a href="http://designfestival.com/the-cicada-principle-and-why-it-matters-to-web-designers/">a recent SitePoint post from Alex Walker</a> in which he discussed a new idea for creating seemingly random tiled backgrounds.</p>
<p>Basically, he discussed using multiple varied transparent tile sizes and placements that correspont to prime numbers as layered background images that acheive a far greater "randomness" in a much smaller file size that would be achieveable with a simple pattern graphic.</p>
<h3>Let&rsquo;s break it down&hellip;</h3>
<p>Take a quick look at the background of this page.  All of the green ones and zeros have been modified by extra layers.  Only the white digits are showing through from the <a href="Base.gif">original tile</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a div filled with only the original tile.</p>
<div id="baseTileOnly">&nbsp;</div>
<p>And now the fun begins!  Here is another div filled with only the first layer and a color to help you see where the transparency in the image is.</p>
<div id="layerOneTileOnly">&nbsp;</div>
<p>And now, we add them together&hellip;</p>
<div id="layersOneAndTwo">&nbsp;</div>
<p>All together, the background of this page is only compsed of 3 fairly small graphic files, but it creates a pattern that doesn't repeat exactly for an unimagineably large grid size.  Not a bad idea at all!</p>
